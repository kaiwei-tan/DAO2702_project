Part of a data visualization and linear regression project on dating site marketing.

The data visualization codes ("EME_male.ipynb" and "EME_female.ipynb") perform descriptive analytics and data visualization on characteristics (e.g. age, occupations, hobbies, etc) of male and female profiles which were web scraped from the dating site East Meet East ("profiles_male.xlsx" and "profiles_female.xlsx").

The linear regression model ("EME_linear.ipynb") investigates the correlation between endorsement cost and other variables (e.g. subscribers, subscriber growth, video frequency, etc) for YouTube channels who had previously collaborated with East Meet East. Feature selection in the form of backwards elimination was also utilised to select the best predictors. Data ("youtuber1.xlsx") was obtained from social media analytics aggregator SocialBlade.com.
